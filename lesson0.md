### Syllabus

The following syllabus lays out the intended path for this course. Please feel free to try to skip ahead, but don't come crying to me for help when you can't figure out what `this` is bound to or why your computer keeps crashing when you try to run your `while` loop<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>.

## Tools

There are a few tools that we are going to use throughout this class. If you are more comfortable using a different tool, you are more than welcome to use it instead, but just know that all any instruction will assume that you are using the following tools.


### Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is an open-source text editor. It is designed to make writing code easier through things like syntax highlighting, plugins, and more.

Popular alternatives are [VIm](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).


### Google Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) is a modern web browser with the best developer tools available.

Once you have Chrome open, you can press CMD+ALT+J to open the web console. We're going to be doing a ton of our work in this console.


### `console.log`

`console.log` is an tool that we are going to use all of the time.

It is a `function`<sup>[2](#note2)</sup> that will print out whatever we give to it.

This is going to be extremely helpful for inspecting our code while it is running.

```js
console.log("This will be printed in the console.");
console.log(10);
console.log("It can also print numbers!");
console.log(["It", "can", "print", "any", "type"]);
```
